# inspirational bot
A bot that texts you (and your friends) a random inspirational quote every day!

For my fellow geeks: the text-messaging actually works through email - turns out that most service providers also have an email address for each number, and any email sent to that address will be re-routed to that number as a text message.

The bot is hosted on (https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)[PythonAnywhere], where it's set as a task to be executed every morning at 5AM PST.
